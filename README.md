## About

The Password Generator is randomly generated and can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numeric values, special characters or a combination of all four. When the button is pressed the user is then prompted to enter the length of their password. The webpage would then ask the user if they want to include an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, a numeric value, or a special character. The password is then displayed on the webpage.
